- All data is stored in your browser.

- Messages act as branches.

- All messages are editable. Pressing [Ctrl+S] saves your edits to the current branch, and pressing [Enter] creates a new branch by default.

- GPT tasks are stored independently, allowing for multiple active responses. This is helpful when you need to create several variations at once and navigate different branches without stopping the response.

- Assistant responses can be continued.

- Answers can have different versions at the same time. For example, one response could be generated by GPT-3 and another by GPT-4.

- The dialogue depth is displayed for each branch. For instance, "[8]" before the prompt indicates eight messages in the current branch.
